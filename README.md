## Course Overview

By the end of this course, you'll have built your own Ava too, capable of:


* Receiving and sending Whatsapp messages 📲
* Understanding your voice 🗣️
* Recognizing your images 🖼️
* Sending voice notes back 🎤
* Sharing updates about its "daily activities" 🚣
* Sending you images of its current activities 🖼️

>You can think of it as a modern reinterpretation of the Turing Test 🤣

Excited? Let's get started!

## Who is this course for?

This course is for Software Engineers, ML Engineers, and AI Engineers who want to level up by building complex end-to-end apps. It's not just a basic "Hello World" tutorial—it's a deep dive into making a production-ready WhatsApp agent.

## What you'll get out of this course

* Build a fully working WhatsApp agent you can chat with on your phone
* Get a solid understanding of how to build LangGraph workflows
* Set up a long-term memory system using Qdrant as a Vector Database
* Use Groq models to power AI Agent responses
* Implement STT systems using Whisper
* Implement TTS systems using ElevenLabs
* Generate high-quality images using diffusion models, like FLUX models
* Process images using VLM models, like llama-3.2-vision
* Create chat interfaces using Chainlit
* Deploy agentic applications to Cloud Run
* Connect agentic applications to the WhatsApp API

## Getting started

Before you begin the course, there are a few things you need to do. 

I'm referring to the virtual environment creation, dependencies installation, `.env` file creation, etc. I know, it's very boring, but it's a necessary evil! 😅

All of this is detailed in the following doc: [GETTING STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

> Make sure you follow the instructions in the doc, as it's crucial for the course to work.
