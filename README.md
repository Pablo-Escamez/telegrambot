## Getting started

Before you begin the course, there are a few things you need to do. 

I'm referring to the virtual environment creation, dependencies installation, `.env` file creation, etc. I know, it's very boring, but it's a necessary evil! 😅

All of this is detailed in the following doc: [GETTING STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

> Make sure you follow the instructions in the doc, as it's crucial for the course to work.
